Since GameCenter is copyrighted Apple code, and therefore, by 
distributing it, i am breaking the law.

So what you have to do is:

Somewhere on the internet you have to download the Game Center.app 
folder with all its stuff inside. Once you have it you're going to ZIP 
it.

Just zip the "Game Center.app" folder and name the zip "Game_Center.zip"


Example how it would look like if you explore the zip:

(GOOD WAY): Game_Center.zip/Game Center.app

(BAD WAY): Game_Center.zip/Game_Center/Game Center.app
